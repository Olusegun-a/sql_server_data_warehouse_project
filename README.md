## Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** with three layers:

| **Layer**      | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bronze Layer** | Stores raw data as-is from the source (CSV files into SQL Server).              |
| **Silver Layer** | Cleanses, standardizes, and normalizes data for analysis.                       |
| **Gold Layer**   | Houses business-ready data in star schema for reporting and analytics.          |
